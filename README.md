- task app using caldav
- use categories as tags to sort
- sort by due date
- color coded tags
- due date countdown



WIP. This is a personal project to solve a problem I have. I like caldav sync for my calendar, but in thunderbird the tasks UI isn't awesome. I'm also using this project to learn python.
